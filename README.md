#  Password Strength Checker

This Python script checks the strength of a given password based on multiple security criteria and provides feedback to help users improve weak passwords.
---
## üìã Features

* Ensures password has a **minimum length** (8 characters).
* Requires at least **one uppercase letter**.
* Requires at least **one lowercase letter**.
* Requires at least **one digit**.
* Requires at least **one special character** (`!@#$%^&*()_+{}[]:;"'<>,.?/~`-=|\`).
* Provides **feedback messages** if the password does not meet criteria.
* Interactive CLI loop until the user types `quit`.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Standard library (`re` for regular expressions)

---

## File Structure

```
password_checker.py   # Main script
README.md             # Documentation (this file)
```

---

##  Usage

1. Save the script as `password_checker.py`.
2. Run it in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python password_checker.py
   ```
3. Enter a password when prompted.

   * To exit, type `quit`.

##  Example Run

```text
--- Password Strength Checker ---
Enter a password to check (or 'quit' to exit): weak123

Password Strength: WEAK
Your password does NOT meet the required criteria. Please address the following:
- Password must contain at least one uppercase letter.
- Password must contain at least one special character (!@#$%^&* etc.).
------------------------------

Enter a password to check (or 'quit' to exit): Strong@123

Password Strength: STRONG
Your password meets all the required criteria.
------------------------------
```

##  Code Overview

### Function: `check_password_strength(password)`

* **Input:** A string (the password).
* **Output:** Boolean (`True` if strong, `False` if weak).
* **Logic:**

  * Checks length (‚â• 8).
  * Scans for uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
  * Prints feedback accordingly.

---

## Security Notes

* This is a **basic password strength checker**.
* For real-world applications, consider additional rules:
  * Prevent dictionary words or usernames.
  * Use password entropy calculations.
  * Integrate with libraries like `zxcvbn`.
